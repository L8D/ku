Takes two values and returns their sum. Note that you can operate on strings
with this but they are added in the reverse order of their arguments.

See [addf](#ku-addf) for a reversed arguments version.

```javascript
var incs = ku.map(ku.add(' inc.'));

incs(['lettuce', 'eggs', 'meaningless sample strings']);
// => ['lettuce inc.', 'eggs inc.', 'meaningless sample strings inc.']
```
