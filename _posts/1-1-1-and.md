Takes two values then performs an AND comparison in the form of `y && x`.

Note that you can use this as a null-value catcher in a similar vein
of Haskell's `Maybe` monad, but more primitive since this is a static
mapping.

```javascript
var toBool = ku.and(true);
toBool(undefined); // => undefined
toBool(9000); // => true
```
